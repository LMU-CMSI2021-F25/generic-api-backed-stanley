AI Review:

For this assignment we wanted to use AI as an additional tool to help guide us at times, especially with some tricky errors we ran into. We mainly used AI for interpreting error codes, learning new features that we did not cover in class (i.e. The table and scroll), as well as helping with the with a few other things like generating the fallback coin names, symbols, prices, etc, as it helped save a lot of time when it came to typing it all out. AI also assisted in guiding us through some tricky visuals items to help us streamline the look of of our webpage when it came to aesthetics. It helped us a lot in many ways but AI isn't perfect so it wasn't helpful every single time we wanted to use it. I don't think using AI in this assignment necessarily hurt us, it just helped us discover some new features and allowed us to streamline the process of creating our app. A lot of our skills came from doing App #1 and since this app was similar, it was straightforward to implement what we wanted to do.
